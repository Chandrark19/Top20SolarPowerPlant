# About Visualization: 
The S visualizations describes the statics of the power plants by Generation capacity by Plant and Country. 

Furthermore, We can easily compare, Area occupied by plants and generation capacity in line and columne chart. 

In the TreeMap, you can see Area (Acres) by each country and plant. 

In the Scatter Plot, it describes the Area by Generation Capacity. The outliers can be observed by avg lines for MWp and Acres.
